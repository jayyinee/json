    <h1> Hospital Playlist is a Korean drama that encapsulates the lives of everyone at Yulje Hospital, but with a special focus on the 5 doctors in their forties. Besides amazingly portraying the characters in the show, the actors also took the time and effort to actually learn how to play the instruments, so they have a band name in real life that is called Mido and Parasol. The band name is a pun for the music scale - Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do. Jeon Mido’s name (the actress who played Chae Song-hwa) is for Mido, and they took some of the other notes to create ‘Falasol.’</h1>
